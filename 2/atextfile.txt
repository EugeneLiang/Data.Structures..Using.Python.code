As a second example, suppose you need to read the contents of a text le and
count the number of letters occurring in the le with the results printed to the
terminal. We know that characters are represented by the ASCII code, which
consists of integer values. The letters of the alphabet, both upper- and lowercase,
are part of what's known as the printable range of the ASCII code. This includes
the ASCII values in the range [32: : :126] along with some of the codes with smaller
values. The latter are known control characters and can include the tab, newline,
and form-feed codes. Since all of the letters will have ASCII values less than 127,
we can create an array of this size and let each element represent a counter for
the corresponding ASCII value. After processing the le, we can traverse over the
elements used as counters for the letters of the alphabet and ignore the others.
The following program provides a solution to this problem using the Array ADT
